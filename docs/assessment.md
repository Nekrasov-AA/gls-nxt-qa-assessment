# Assessment Notes (Required Reflections)

## 1) Understanding the Product

### What does this product seem to care about more than other things?
- Converting users quickly from configuration -> cart (frictionless purchase).
- Correct pricing and delivery option clarity (users see price differences and savings).
- Minimizing user input errors (recipient address correctness is critical for delivery success).

### Who are the primary users?
- Private customers shipping parcels domestically/internationally (non-technical consumers).
- Internal stakeholders: customer support and operations teams who handle failed deliveries, refunds, and delivery exceptions.

### What assumptions did you have to make?
- No access to backend / internal docs, so validations, pricing rules, and integrations are treated as black-box.
- I assumed the main “critical path” is: configure parcel -> provide recipient -> choose delivery option -> add to cart (no real payment).
- I assumed the site is production and protected by anti-bot mechanisms; headless automation may be blocked.

## 2) Quality Risks

### What could realistically go wrong for customers or the business?
- Incorrect pricing / wrong delivery option applied -> revenue loss, refunds, complaints.
- Broken validation or address formatting -> failed delivery, returned parcels, extra fees.
- Cart/checkout issues (item not added, wrong quantity, incorrect summary) -> lost conversion.
- Localisation/country-specific constraints (weight/size limits, destinations) causing wrong availability or silent failures.
- Performance issues on critical path (slow config page) -> user drop-off.

### Which risks worried you the most, and why?
- Pricing and option selection correctness (direct revenue impact + trust).
- Validation/address correctness (delivery failure is expensive and harms reputation).
- Any issue with “Add to cart” directly impacts revenue because customers can’t proceed to checkout.

## 3) Decisions & Trade-offs

### What did you choose to focus on?
- Risk-based approach: identify critical path and highest impact failures.
- Minimal, stable UI smoke automation to demonstrate capability (pytest + Selenium).
- CI workflow that provides value even when public production blocks headless UI runs.

### What did you intentionally not do?
- Full end-to-end checkout/payment (explicitly avoided real payments).
- Deep coverage of all country/size permutations (timebox constraint).
- Anti-bot bypass or “stealth” techniques (not appropriate for production).

### What would be your next step if you had one more day?
- Add a small set of high-value functional UI checks:
  - required field validation for recipient
  - price changes when switching delivery options
  - add-to-cart -> verify cart item summary
- Expand risk-based exploratory charters (edge cases: special chars in address, invalid postcodes, max size/weight boundaries).
- Propose running E2E against staging/internal environment or allowlisting CI runners to make headless smoke reliable.

## 4) Use of Tools / AI (if applicable)

### How did you use AI tools?
- Used GitHub Copilot Chat to speed up scaffolding, small refactors, and CI workflow drafting.
- Used AI as a “pair programmer” for troubleshooting pytest discovery and small design decisions.

### What outputs did you accept, modify, or reject?
- Accepted: basic project skeleton, pytest fixtures structure, workflow scaffolding.
- Modified: removed over-verbose/“AI style” comments, simplified page objects and tests, kept only pragmatic artifacts on failure.
- Rejected: any suggestion to bypass Cloudflare/Turnstile or use stealth approaches.

### Did anything generated by AI seem misleading or incorrect?
- Initial suggestions assumed headless E2E would work reliably against public production. In practice, Cloudflare/Turnstile blocks headless sessions, so CI strategy had to be adjusted accordingly.
